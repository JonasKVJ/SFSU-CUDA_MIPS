# SFSU-MIPS
Several courses on the MIPS ISA taken at San Francisco State University.
The first course was Machine Structures taken Fall 2015 and the second was a high-level elective class called Computer Organization, taken during the Spring-18 semester. 
Overview of assignments: 
- Project 1: Optimization of pipelined instructions through reorganization, both in case of a single-issue and a multi-issue processor. One part of the project also involves unrolling a loop, such that one new iteration consists of four old ones. 

General topics in the two courses: Binary and Hexadecimal, Translating C++ to MIPS Assembly, Logic Circuits such as D Flip-flops, Multiplexors, Registers, Clocks; Pipelining, Caches (Direct Mapping), Advanced Pipelining (8 stage pipelines vs. 5 stage ones), Loop Unrolling, Exceptions & Interrupts, Stalls, Speculation, Datapaths & Control Signals. 

Note: This repository will be updated progressively, as more projects are completed during the semester
